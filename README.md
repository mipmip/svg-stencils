# SVG Stencils

SVG Stencils is a community driven stencil library.

SVG Stencils provides stencils for app's like Inkscape. It uses the drag
and drop ability of modern browsers. You can drag components directly to your
desktop application.

All stencils, toolkits and components in SVG Stencils are open source and free
to use commercially.

## How to use

Using SVG Stencils is easy. Place your browser window next to your design app. Open svg-stencils.github.io in the browser and select a stencil with components you'd like to use. Drag a component from your browser directly into the canvas of your design app. The components are in SVG format, so your can change texts, element sizes etc....
